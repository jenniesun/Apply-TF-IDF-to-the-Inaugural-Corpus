## Apply TF-IDF to the Inaugural Corpus 

The Jupyter Notebook file answers these five questions below:

1. Define or augment a set of stopwords for this problem
2. Construct a document-by-term matrix (documents will be rows, terms will be columns), along with a vocabulary while controlling for stopwords
3. Write functions to compute TF-IDF and apply those to the document-by-term matrix
4. Find the closest historic inaugural address to the 2017 address by President Trump
5. Use the PCA transformation and plot the inaugural address along the first two principal components
